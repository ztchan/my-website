    <blockquote>What determines national preferences for institutionalizing FDI screening? Over the past decade, advanced economies worldwide have tightened their national investment screening mechanisms (ISMs) for foreign direct investment (FDI). In March 2019, the European Union (EU) adopted its first common FDI screening framework. Based on extensive interviews with high-level EU and country officials involved in the negotiation process, and using a unique measure of national support for the EU-wide ISM created through the first-ever elite survey on this subject matter, we find that countries with higher technological levels were more supportive of FDI screening due to concerns over unreciprocated technological transfer. We also find sector-dependent effects of Chinese FDI on country-level support for FDI screening: Countries with high levels of Chinese FDI in strategic sectors are more likely to support the EU ISM, while those with high levels of Chinese investment in low-tech sectors tend to oppose screening. Our overall findings suggest that EU investment screening, and national-level screening in general, might become more restrictive in the future, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.</blockquote>

* "Affluence without Influence? The Inducement Dilemma in Economic Statecraft." (Job market paper)

    <blockquote>When can economic inducements––such as foreign aid, investment, and especially large-scale development initiatives––buy influence abroad? Countries often use financial favors to induce foreign policy concessions from other countries. The effectiveness of such inducements hinges on whether the sender can credibly threaten to halt or withdraw the inducements when the target does not concede. I examine a substantial set of development initiatives that are lucrative not just for the target but also for the sender. I argue that when the sender profits from the inducement it gives, it will not cut off the inducement, even if the target does not concede. I test this inducement dilemma in China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Using over 200 elite interviews, official documents published by the Chinese government, and original datasets on China's overseas project contracts, I show that Beijing's dual goals of the BRI are to (1) tackle domestic economic and environmental problems by encouraging Chinese companies to construct infrastructure abroad, and (2) gain international acceptance of China's development and governance models. Consistent with my argument, the economic motive undercuts the foreign policy goal. These infrastructure projects promote international support for China's governance and development models only when these projects do not serve China's domestic goal of exporting excess industrial capacity.</blockquote>

* "Aid for Status? Experimental Evidence from China and the United States." (with <a href="https://ppaweb.hku.hk/f/quek" target="_blank">Kai Quek</a>)

    <blockquote>Does international status affect aid preferences? We conduct the first experimental study of aid preferences in an emerging donor country using original survey data from China, and a parallel study in the United States. We find striking differences in the aid preferences of both countries that support the status-seeking hypothesis: Chinese support for aid increases significantly when foreign aid provision is framed as a means of the country gaining higher international status, but Americans remain unswayed. We also use causal forests, a machine learning algorithm, to systematically evaluate heterogeneous treatment effects across a wide range of dispositional covariates in a principled manner with honest inferences. The results indicate status has especially pronounced positive impacts on the aid preferences of cosmopolitan Chinese citizens but negative impacts on Americans who are less cosmopolitan and have lower income.</blockquote>

* "Weaponizing Facts: How Revisionist States Polarize Foreign Audiences with Factual Content." (with <a href="https://www.noelfoster.com/" target="_blank">Noel Foster</a>)

    <blockquote>How do revisionist states leverage new technologies to disrupt foreign politics? Drawing on extensive elite interviews and insights from behavioral economics and social psychology, we argue that revisionist powers can use strategic narratives — factual accounts of issues controversial across pre-existing societal cleavages — to polarize voters through a combination of confirmation bias and reactance. Contrary to recent literature on fake news, we present evidence on the political economy of social media platforms that renders fake news impracticable and counter-productive in most markets. We test the effects of Russian strategic narratives using original survey experiments in Estonia. We show that exposure to factual content on migration and the Soviet legacy polarized Estonian voters along ethnolinguistic cleavages by making ethnic Estonians more likely to support right-leaning nationalist parties, while pushing the Russian-speaking minority to back left-leaning ethnic interest parties. A polarized population serves the revisionist state sender’s objective of paralyzing policy-making in the target state.</blockquote>

* "Transparent Machine Learning through Improved Variable Importance Measures." (with <a href="https://scholar.princeton.edu/ratkovic/home" target="_blank">Marc Ratkovic</a>)

<button type="button" class="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="vim">Abstract</button>

    <blockquote>Boosting and random forests are among the best off-the-shelf prediction tools. These methods offer a variable importance measure (VIM), which is a cumulative measure of the improvement in accuracy over the algorithm.  We show existing variable importance measures, as implemented, are biased, returning positive scores on irrelevant variables.  Intuitively, if a variable is irrelevant but correlates with a relevant variable, this correlation may lead to an improvement in performance may be misattributed to the irrelevant variable.   We introduce a method that removes this bias.  The method works by separating each predictor into a component explained by other predictors (a "predicted variable"), and a component not (a "partialed out variable").  We assess variable importance only through any improvement attributable to the latter.  We prove the method returns a valid VIM, meaning it is mean-zero  and asymptotically normal for irrelevant variables.  Simulation evidence and applications to UCI data suggest the method also performs favorably relative to several existing machine learning methods in terms of predictive accuracy.</blockquote>
