Welcome! I am a <a href="https://politics.princeton.edu/people/zenobia-chan" target="_blank">PhD candidate</a> at the <a href="http://politics.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Politics</a> at <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Princeton University</a> and a <a href="https://www.usip.org/grants-fellowships/jennings-randolph-peace-scholarship-dissertation-program/current-peace-scholars#Chan" target="_blank">USIP-Minerva Peace and Security Scholar Fellow</a> at the United States Institute of Peace (USIP). I study signaling in foreign policy and the international and domestic politics of economic statecraft. My research interests lie in the intersection of international political economy, security studies, and computational social sciences. 
</p>

<p>
My dissertation book project investigates how positive economic statecraft––such as foreign aid, loans, and investment––work in influencing preferences and behavior of elites and public abroad. Drawing on insights from behavioral economics, political psychology, and the domestic politics of foreign policy, I propose a unifying framework to explain the effectiveness of various types of positive economic statecraft based on their cost contingency and time horizon. I combine archival materials, elite interviews, experimental data, and large-<i>N</i> statistical analysis to test my theory in three sets of cases with substantial policy implications: Chinese foreign aid and infrastructure projects in Africa, Chinese support for the Euro during the European debt crisis, and the Baltic States’ arms trades with their NATO security partners. 
</p>

<p>
My other <a href="./research">research projects</a> examine the effects of Chinese and Russian information operations on voter polarization abroad and develop machine learning techniques for discovering heterogeneous treatment effects. 
</p>

<p>
My work received the 2020 Timothy E. Cook Best Graduate Student Paper in Political Communication Honorable Mention from the American Political Science Association. I was awarded the <a href="https://gradschool.princeton.edu/costs-funding/sources-funding/fellowships/competitive" target="_blank">Prize Fellowship in Social Sciences</a> in the 2020–21 academic year. My research has also been supported by Facebook, Inc., the Global Studies Institute at the University of Geneva, the Mamdouha S. Bobst Center for Peace and Justice, the Niehaus Center for Globalization and Governance, the Center for the Study of Democratic Politics, the Princeton Institute for International and Regional Studies, and the European Union Programme at Princeton University. 
</p>

<p>
Much of my research is inspired by <a href="./policy">my background in international affairs, public policy</a>, and software engineering. Prior to my doctoral studies, I was an analyst and geo-data engineer at Google, Inc. I have also served analyst and consultant positions at the United Nations, OECD, and World Bank on issues related to development assistance, energy policy, and infrastructure financing. 
</p>

<p>
I hold a Master of International Affairs in International Security Policy from <a href="https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/" target="_blank">Columbia University</a>, an MA <i>summa cum laude</i> in International Economic Policy from <a href="https://www.sciencespo.fr/" target="_blank">Sciences Po Paris</a>, where I was an Alexandre Yersin Scholar of the French Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs, and a BBA (1st Hon) in International Business and Global Management from <a href="https://hku.hk/" target="_blank">the University of Hong Kong</a>.
